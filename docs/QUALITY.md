# AI TDD Quality Principles

This document outlines the core principles for AI-driven Test-Driven Development (TDD) within the Tsumiki × Web3AIVibeCodingKit integration framework.

## Core Principles

### 1. Spec-First Development
- **Requirements Before Code**: Always start with comprehensive specification documents before writing any code
- **AI-Assisted Specification**: Use AI tools to generate and refine requirements from high-level concepts
- **Living Documentation**: Specifications should evolve with the codebase and remain current
- **Stakeholder Validation**: All specifications must be validated by relevant stakeholders before implementation

### 2. Test-First Implementation
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Follow strict TDD cycles with AI assistance
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage with meaningful test cases
- **AI-Generated Test Cases**: Leverage AI to generate edge cases and comprehensive test scenarios
- **Test Documentation**: All tests must clearly document their purpose and expected behavior

### 3. Quality-First Approach
- **Code Quality Gates**: No code merges without passing quality checks
- **AI Code Review**: Use AI tools to perform initial code review and identify potential issues
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and quality checks on every commit
- **Performance Considerations**: All code must meet performance benchmarks

## AI Integration Guidelines

### Multi-Model Strategy
- **Gemini for Planning**: Use Gemini for requirements definition, task breakdown, and review
- **Claude for Implementation**: Use Claude for coding, debugging, and refactoring
- **Cross-Validation**: Always validate AI outputs with different models when possible

### Context Engineering
- **Rich Context Provision**: Provide comprehensive context to AI tools including:
  - Project specifications
  - Existing codebase structure
  - Previous decisions and rationale
  - Target architecture and constraints
- **Incremental Context Building**: Build context incrementally through the development process
- **Context Validation**: Ensure AI tools have accurate and up-to-date context

### AI Tool Configuration
- **Custom Instructions**: Maintain project-specific instruction files for each AI tool
- **Consistent Prompting**: Use standardized prompts for common development tasks
- **Tool-Specific Optimization**: Optimize prompts and workflows for each AI tool's strengths

## Web3 Development Standards

### Smart Contract Quality
- **Security First**: All smart contracts must pass security audits
- **Gas Optimization**: Optimize for gas efficiency without compromising security
- **Formal Verification**: Use formal verification tools where applicable
- **Test Networks**: Comprehensive testing on test networks before mainnet deployment

### Frontend Development
- **User Experience**: Prioritize intuitive and accessible user interfaces
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamless integration with blockchain interactions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for blockchain-specific issues
- **Performance**: Optimize for various network conditions and device capabilities

## Development Workflow Quality

### Integration Process
- **Repository Validation**: Validate both Tsumiki and VibeKit repositories before integration
- **Unified Structure**: Maintain consistent project structure across all integrations
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized management of AI tool configurations
- **Version Control**: Proper versioning and change management

### Command Execution Quality
- **Idempotent Operations**: All commands should be safe to run multiple times
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **User Feedback**: Clear feedback and progress indicators for long-running operations

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Development Velocity**: Track development speed and identify bottlenecks
- **Quality Metrics**: Monitor code quality, test coverage, and defect rates
- **AI Effectiveness**: Measure the effectiveness of AI-assisted development
- **User Satisfaction**: Gather feedback from developers using the framework

### Learning and Adaptation
- **Retrospectives**: Regular retrospectives to identify improvement opportunities
- **Best Practices Updates**: Continuously update best practices based on experience
- **Tool Evolution**: Stay current with AI tool capabilities and adjust workflows accordingly
- **Community Feedback**: Incorporate feedback from the developer community

## Compliance and Standards

### Code Standards
- **Formatting**: Consistent code formatting using automated tools
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and README files
- **Naming Conventions**: Clear and consistent naming conventions
- **Architecture Patterns**: Follow established architectural patterns and principles

### Security Standards
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and security scanning of dependencies
- **Secret Management**: Proper handling and storage of sensitive information
- **Access Control**: Appropriate access controls for repositories and deployments
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain audit trails for all significant changes
